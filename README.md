# 🎮 iOS-DiscordPresence
Jailbreak tweak that implements Discord Playing Presence like Samsung Game Launcher. [How does this tweak work?](https://github.com/YuzuZensai/DiscordMobilePlayingCLI)

This is my first jailbreak tweak <3, so it might not be perfect

## 📃 TODOs

- [X] Make preference menu, and some basic settings
- [ ] Make the tweak send ``UPDATE`` request every x interval, to keep the status active
- [ ] Fetching the discord token (Somehow hooking the Discord app? No idea yet)
- [X] Make rate limits to prevent spamming the API

## 🔧 Installation

Prerequisites: [Theos](https://theos.dev/)

1. Clone this repository ``git clone https://github.com/YuzuZensai/iOS-DiscordPresence.git``

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

iOS-DiscordPresence utilizes Discord API that is outside OAuth2/bot API scope.

``/api/v6/presences``

Automating normal user accounts (generally called "self-bots") outside of the OAuth2/bot API is a **violation** of Discord [Terms Of service](https://discord.com/terms) & [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines), and can result in account termination if found. **I do not take any responsibility, liability, or anything that happened on your Discord Account.**
